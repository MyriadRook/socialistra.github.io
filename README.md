## Contributing

This site is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) and hosted on github pages.

1. [Create a GitHub Account](https://github.com/join) or login. Then come [back here](https://github.com/SocialistRA/socialistra.github.io/).
2. Click the Fork button on the top right of the page. This creates your own personal copy of the site, that you are free to edit.
3. Before making any changes, please click the Branch button, and type in a short, descriptive name for the change you plan to make. Then click 
Create branch. This holds each set of changes together, for easier management.
4. Pages and posts can be edited by clicking on the file name, then the edit button (looks like a pencil). Blog posts live in the _posts directory, 
and pages are in the root directory (example README.md or about.md). Everything is written in Markdown for styling, which is used in many 
comment sections such as Reddit.
5. New files can be created or uploaded using the buttons at the top of the file list.
6. After editing or uploading files, at the bottom of the screen there is a Commit Changes section. Please describe your changes, and select "Commit directly to the (Branch Name) branch."
7. Once you're done with your changes and want to submit them for review to the main site, you should see "This branch is X commits ahead of SocialistRA:master". 
To the right of that is a Pull Request button. Click it, edit description if need be, then click "Create pull request".
8. The active contributers will review your changes or blog post, suggest edits, or approve.

Thanks for contributing!
